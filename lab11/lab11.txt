Use streams to implement all of these

1) Print all even numbers from 0 to 100
- Then, modify your algorithm to add only odd numbers 0, 100
- Then, modify your algorithm to remove prime numbers

2) Grep from BufferedReader
- Count occurrences of a given search word
- Return line for each occurrence of word (regular grep) 

3) Given a list of strings, return each that is a palindrome.
- Modify your algorithm to return the original word (not inverted)

4) Implement the Fizz Buzz algorithm
- Iterate from 1 to 100, print "Fizz" for every number divisible by 3 and "Buzz" for every number divisible by 5

5) Implement the game of life
