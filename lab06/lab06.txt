Write a simple chat server:
- ChatReceiver sets up a server socket on port 8080
- Use telnet to connect to it
- Send your name to establish connection on the telnet side
- Receiver wait for telnet to send name, then responds with its own name
- Telnet side then starts conversation
- Only one side at a time can speak while the other is waiting

Solution is in ChatReceiver. ChatConnector can be used instead of telnet.
